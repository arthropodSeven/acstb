        I've had a lot of fun following along with Heydon Pickering and Andy
        Bell in their fantastic book,{' '}
        <a href="https://every-layout.dev">Every Layout.</a> Scattered about the
        internet, there are thirty million prescriptions for "how to build a
        layout system for your website," but Every Layout is the first such text
        to teach me something about what HTML is, what CSS is, how JavaScript
        ties them together, and how to survive using all three without burning
        out or killing your colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The links below lead to writeups for each component I've recreated from
        the book for use on this website. I'll post updates as I progress
        through the text. Demos will be included where they aren't extremely
        time-consuming.
